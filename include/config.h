 * skill values relative to this value.  This value should be somewhere
 * between 0 and /std/body/skills.c::MAX_SKILL_VALUE * <number of skills>.
 * Typically, it wouldn't change but a mud that is just starting out might
 * adjust this (causing a reevaluation of everybody) if a number of players
 * are reaching or exceeding this value (which is quite legal).  This value
 * is simply an aid for players to measure progress against (setting it to
 * the maximum would mean that players wouldn't really ever budge anywhere).
