--=== High Mortals (Guild Help) ===--

It is necessary to complete a rite of passage in a guild to advance beyond level 20.  Once you reach level 21 in your primary guild, you are considered a high mortal.  You may then attempt to change your primary guild, and become a master and teacher of your current primary guild.
