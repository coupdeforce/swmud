 --=== Haggle ===--  (Merchant Guild Command)

 Usage: haggle [on | off]

 A merchant can haggle for lower prices when they buy, and higher prices when they sell.  This skill is automatic when turned on.

 Merchants can type 'haggle' to see if they are haggling or not, as well as turn it on with 'haggle on' and off with 'haggle off'.
