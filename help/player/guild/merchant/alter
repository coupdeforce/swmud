 --=== Alter ===--  (Merchant Guild Command)

 Usage: alter <object>
        alter weight of <object>
        alter value of <object>
        alter capacity of <object>
        alter name of <object>

 A merchant can alter items in four ways:

    Weight - An object can be made lighter.
    Value - An object can be made to be worth more credits.
    Capacity - A container can be made to carry more.
    Name - A new name for an object can be chosen from its available IDs.

 A merchant can also check an items alteration status simply by doing 'alter <object>'.  More experienced merchants will perform better alterations, and have a greater chance to leave an item open to further alterations.
