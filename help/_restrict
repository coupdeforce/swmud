# File: _restrict
# Created: 25-OCT-94. Deathblade.
#
# This file is used to describe the level-restrictions of the
# sub-directories located in this directory.  The help system
# can restrict help based on user "level" only at this level
# of the directory tree -- further restrictions are not available.
#
# The format of this file is simple:
#
#   <dirname> : <min-level>
#
# This specifies that the topics in the given directory can
# only be seen by somebody with the given level.  If a
# sub-directory exists and is not listed here, then it is
# assumed to have a min-level of 0 (players can see the
# topics).  Level 99 means the help_d will ignore it.
#
# And, of course, lines beginning with # are ignored
#
# This file is parsed by help_d.c.
