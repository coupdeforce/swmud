 -= Su =-  (Wizard Command)

 Usage: su [name | (race)]

 Examples:

    su
    su testchar
    su (mon calamari)
    su (restricted-race)

 This command allows you to switch users.  Without a name as an argument, it will update your character.  With a name, you will be prompted for a password.

 Your test player characters may use this to switch as well.  To use it for updating they must be added to the "testchars" group.

 Regular players are not able to use this to switch to another regular player.

 It reclones the body with a new object ID, so there would be a few big problems with no restriction for regular players:
 1. NPCs would no longer be aggressive.
 2. If multiple characters are allowed, people could switch back and forth immediately from the current location instead of the start location.

 Switching works if your current character or the character you want to switch to is a wizard or testchar.

 You can also use this to change your current race.

 As a wizard who switches to a test character, you will still see messages from your wizard character's channels.  This command is actually located in /cmds/player/ so that wizards can switch back.
