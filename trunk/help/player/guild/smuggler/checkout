 --=== Checking Out ===--  (Smuggler Guild Command)

 Usage: checkout <target>

 Smugglers can determine how many credits someone is carrying.  They can also detect items that another smuggler of lower level has concealed.  Primary smugglers can detect what a non-primary smuggler is concealing, regardless of level, if their combined checkout and hiding skill is greater than their targets hiding skill.
