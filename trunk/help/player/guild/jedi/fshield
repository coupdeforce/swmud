--=== Force Shield (Jedi Guild Command) ===--

 Usage: fshield

 The Jedi will attempt to surround themselves with a shield of the Force, further increasing their defense of melee attacks.

 It is much more effective while wearing Jedi robes or Sith armor, or no armor at all.

 A Jedi who uses this will be drawn closer to the Light side of the Force.
