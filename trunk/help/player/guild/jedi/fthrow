--=== Force Lift (Jedi Guild Command) ===--

 Usage: fthrow <object> from <location> to <destination>

 Jedi can use their study of telekinesis through the force to throw objects from one place to another.

 Locations and destinations may be room exits, as well as target names, 'here' and 'me'.

 Throwing an object at a living being will draw you closer to the Dark side of the Force.
