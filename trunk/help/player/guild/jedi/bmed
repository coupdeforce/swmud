--=== Battle Meditation (Jedi Guild Command) ===--

 Usage: bmed

 A Jedi can influence the course of a battle, either positively for their party (Light Jedi) or negatively for their enemies (Dark Jedi).

 A Light Jedi may begin meditation in or out of combat, with it positively affecting themselves and any players who they are not in combat with.  A player's living NPC followers will be supported by this in the future.

 A Dark Jedi may only begin meditation while in combat, as it will affect all hostile players and NPCs in the room.
